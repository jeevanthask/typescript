//What is the Never type in TypeScript?
//The never type represents the type of values that never occur. For instance,
//never is the return type for a function expression or an arrow function expression
//that always throws an exception or one that never returns. Variables also acquire the type
//never when narrowed by any type guards that can never be true.
